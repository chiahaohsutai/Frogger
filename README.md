*Course Name:* Fundamentals of Computer Science 2

Team Members: Chia Hao Hsu Tai (myself) and Mahiro Yamakawa

### Project Desription:

Design and implemetation of the videogame Frogger. Player must reach the other side of the world without being ran over by a car or falling into the water. The player can move in all directions but if the player leaves the screen at any moment, the player looses. When the player gets on top of the log, the frog will move in the direction of the log. The frog will face the direction in which it is moving.

### Design:

The implemetation and design of the project are through DrRackets Intermediate Student Leraning Language. The project utilices the build-in big-bang library to animate all the moving parts and responces to user inputs. The design focuses on abstracting methods/functions by using DrRackets list abstractions. This abstractions allowed the project to quickly iterate and modify the elements in a list. Moreover, theres a focus on generalizing functions so they can be used multiple times and for different data types. 

### How do I run the game:
- Download DrRacket (link: https://racket-lang.org/)
- Download and open the racket file from the repository
- Hit run on the racket IDE
- On the command window type the following and hit enter: (main world-init)

### Sneak Peek into the game:
